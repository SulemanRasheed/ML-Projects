# German Credit Data Classification
[credit_g](https://www.openml.org/d/31) dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. The dataset includes several features like age, employment, credit history, savings status etc. In this exercise, we'll merely focus on three classification algorithms 
1. K nearest neighbors
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linaer SVM
And to keep things simple, accuracy would be used as evaluation metric

This exercise is a part of Homework 2 of open source [applied ML course taught by Andreas Mueller](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~amueller/comsw4995s20/schedule/).
